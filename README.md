# DRAWscii - blindpaint, refurbished.
DRAWscii is like blindpaint 2, blindpaint but, in my opinion, better.

its objective of blindly painting is gone, sad, i know. but atleast you get to know what you're doing!!

## what does it have, however?
DRAWscii will have:
1. artwork viewing
	- unlike blindpaint, you can see what you're drawing and improve it
2. cross-platform support
	- just like blindpaint, except you need to compile it yourself
3. DLL/shared library file (not done)
	- again, like blindpaint, but you need to compile it yourself
4. compiled code
	- hell yeah no more binary size measuring in megabytes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## why did you kill blindpaint?
i didn't mean to kill it but i think it's just been perfected (it's not.)

if you want it to come back try forking it and adding what you want (no brainrot please for the love of god)

## how do i run it?
you need to first compile it, to do so, make sure you have CLang, git and makebuild installed

if you don't have those installed, install them, you'll need them (you don't need makebuild on windows)

after that, clone the repo and compile the main file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/greg0rygreg/drawscii.git
cd drawscii
make # use the old way in the main.cpp file if you're a windows user
```
