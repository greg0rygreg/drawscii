# DRAWscii - blindpaint, refurbished.
DRAWscii is like blindpaint 2, blindpaint but, in my opinion, better.

its objective of blindly painting is gone, sad, i know. but atleast you get to know what you're doing!!

## what does it have, however?
DRAWscii will have:
1. artwork viewing
	- unlike blindpaint, you can see what you're drawing and improve it
2. cross-platform support
	- just like blindpaint, except you need to compile it yourself
3. DLL/shared library file (not done)
	- again, like blindpaint, but you need to compile it yourself
4. compiled code
	- hell yeah no more binary size measuring in megabytes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

## why did you kill blindpaint?
i didn't mean to kill it but i think it's just been perfected (it's not.)

if you want it to come back try forking it and adding what you want (no brainrot please for the love of god)

## how do i run it?
you need to first compile it, to do so, make sure you have CLang/mingw and git installed

if you don't have those installed, install them

after that, clone the repo and compile the main.cpp file:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/greg0rygreg/drawscii.git
cd drawscii
# follow the instructions on the top comment of main.cpp
```
