# DRAWscii - blindpaint, refurbished.
DRAWscii is like blindpaint 2, blindpaint but, in my opinion, better.

its objective of blindly painting is gone, sad, i know. but atleast you get to know what you're doing!!

## what will it have, however?
DRAWscii will have:
1. artwork viewing
	- unlike blindpaint, you can see what you're drawing and improve it
2. ~~cross-platform support~~
	- ~~just like blindpaint, windows users can use it too (no macos, apple products suck)~~ due to a few issues with C++, there won't be pre-compiled binaries for windows
3. ~~DLL~~ shared library file
	- currently no windows support because i don't have windows, only linux
4. compiled code
	- hell yeah no more file size measuring in megabytes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (linux only)

## why did you kill blindpaint?
i didn't mean to kill it but i think it's just been perfected (it's not.)

if you want it to come back try forking it and adding what you want (no brainrot please for the love of god)
